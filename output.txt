1a. Is innovation partly thinking in a larger frame? Is thinking of the details often a hinderance in a creative process? What is the limit to the large frame then?
1b. In reference to "Backpack Makers Rethink Student Sample" and ghanathinktank, they both suggest mentally moving out from the original frame to create new ideas - does that mean moving onto a larger frame, or into a new one altogether (or both)?
2. In reference to Outside the Citadel, Social Practice Art Is Intended to Nurture, can art be redefined as not only a product meant to engage an audience, but more broadly some tangible or intangible factor utilized to evoke emotions and spread messages? This reminds me of Social Cognition, a course that taught me of different "mental lenses." More specifically, how one frames any concept alters how it is viewed and utilized. I feel this article was targeting the idea of pushing boundaries, changing the Western "mental lenses" towards art in general. Moreover, it also reminded me of "? + ? = 10" concept in Tuesday's class - the possibilities, though it may be limited, are still more than one.

-While the book "Service Innovation Handbook Forward" suggests "Designing is about specifics" (5), Mr. Rothenhaus from the article "Backpack Makers Rethink a Student Staple" exhibits his experience of "research steered us away from trying to design pockets and compartments for specific uses." Regarding the opposing ideas proposed in readings, is there an ideal definition of or approach to designs? If there is, should we aim toward the "specific" or not?
-Rakowitz's paraSITE and DJ Kool Herc's ethics presented in his book "Can't Stop Won't Stop" seem to share a keyword in common: "ghetto" (13). I was taught culture is a thing that majority of people are accustomed to. However, these two artists counter-argued with their works presenting voice of under-representatives. Definition of culture, is it truly what majority follows? If not, what is the definition of a culture?

I find it interesting that the JanSport team uses the term “third spaces” to describe “the cafe tables or park benches that become impromptu work spaces.” Last semester I was introduced to Edward Soja’s concept of “thirdspace,” which seems to be what JanSport is referring to -- “the space we give meaning to. . .the experience of living,” a space where “everything comes together” such as the real and the imagined, the abstract and the concrete. Does this term thirdspace make sense when speaking about social-practice art, or art in general; are most artists (most innovators, designers...) trying to make sense of the thirdspace? Are the ThinkTanks or hip-hop or paraSITE examples of thirdspace/what we can do with thirdspace?
 
Why is art so difficult to define? Is there a better term that could be used for “art” that might make people more open to how varied art can be? Or is it really art anymore if it has a different name? Interesting that we have the term social-practice art. Does this imply that “social-practice art” must be termed social-practice for it to be accepted as a kind of art, not art in essence?
 
“People want to stay more connected socially, even in the outdoors. . .Even if they’re in the back country, they’re using solar panels, GoPros, GPS.” The “outdoors” is becoming innovated? What is the purpose of bringing innovation when on a hike or on a backpacking trip, etc? Is the purpose to be more socially connected working? What is the outdoors -- is the meaning changing? Is it a thirdspace?

1. How can we compare and contrast Michael Rakowitz's paraSITE with other ideas like the Tent Jacket (http://www.gizmag.com/jakpak-all-in-one-jacket-swag-sleeping-bag/14477/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.) or even this more elaborate movable architecture (http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/party-dress-dana-karla-karwas.html (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)? Furthermore, these three innovations can be separated into different categories according to their intended purposes; for example, paraSITE is embedded within social activism, the Tent Jacket can be identified with consumerism and a business model, the party dress is primarily art and performance focused. What is the relevance of these distinctions, is there relevance?  
2. Drawing from the article "Outside the Citadel, Social Practice Art is Intended to Nurture", art is often times a reflection of the world at a certain time -as social practice art becomes more prominent, what does that say about our world today? About our values and concerns? About our interactions?

The readings were all really interesting. My first question is more of technical question about the paraSITE project. I know there were legal considerations they had to account for, but wasn't using the outtake HVAC system vents to inflate paraSITEs dangerous? My second question is about the legal implications of trespassing and whether that was a problem in this project? I definitely think the idea is amazing!
Lastly, the Thinkthank project made me think of how we define developing countries and considers the "first world" countries to have the brightest minds and technologies, whereas sometimes the people in the so-called " third world" countries see the world in a simpler way.

“Outside the Citadel, Social Practice Art is Intended to Nurture” explains that museums are currently struggling to find a way to showcase social practice. How could the use of education, as Pablo Helguera discusses in his handbook, be the solution?


JanSport made an effort to reimagine their backpacks out of financial incentive (wanting to keep its customers). Should innovation be spurred by necessity, as with JanSport, or by sparks of creativity? Would either incentive create “better” ideas?

I'm very perplexed by the paraSITE things, I'll call them "igloos." I'm trying to figure out what the point is, which sounds almost strange when the "igloos" clearly have a function as an improved sleeping place for homeless people. But I had to wonder how much money was spent distributing 30 igloos, versus improving the structures that get homeless people off the street. Is it supposed to be some sort of criticism of capitalism by reversing a supposed parasitism of capitalism on the general populace? Leading to the question, what is art? I still don't even have a clue. The reading about social practice brought up that social practice's "political nature...  propels it into territory that is unfamiliar to many artists and art institutions." But isn't a lot of art politically pointed? That isn't new, right? And if the purpose of paraSITE isn't a subtextual criticism of capitalism, is it really less political than a lot of traditional art? And with respect to the David Letterman-style questions, does answering "no" to the Question 22 (“If your project was a math equation, did the sum always end up as a critique of capitalism?") mean that the art is not social practice? Is a critique of capitalism a part of the definition?
And that ended up being many more than 2-3 questions, but I am thoroughly confused and I don't want to pretend that I'm less confused in order to fulfill the prompt.

Questions: 
1.)  As functionality, social relevance and social engagement become increasingly important to contemporary artists, art seems to take a turn from the traditional fine arts form( primarily for aesthetics) to relatively more accessible, community-oriented projects that emphasize . Is  such modern practice degrading given that it compromises the visual and emotional beauty and value of art? How does one critique/ measure the success of such art form?

2.) Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: “It’s about you and me, connecting one to one. That’s why it has universal appeal. It has given young people a way to understand their world.” 
How has social practice revealed the general world views /desires of people nowadays?

3.) Should social practice focus on responding to existing phenomenons/ problems and providing solutions( e.g. paraSITE) , or should it focus on creating alternatives/ new trends( e.g. Ghana Think Tank)? Does it really matter?

After reading "Backpack Makers Rethink a Student Staple" and comparing it to "Ghana ThinkTank" the action of reaching out to a population samples for critiques was similar. What I am curious about is -- did these researchers do anything to directly help those who had supplied them with information? When reading the "Backpack" article I am curious if JanSport donated any backpacks to the homeless whom gave information and perspective on their products? To me the homeless seem to be the ones in the most need for a sturdy backpack. Also, how would a homeless person afford the expensive price of these backpacks? Taking the influence of some one into a product, which is not affordable to the person providing that research seems disingenuous.
But comparing that to the "Ghana ThinkTank" article,  I am curious if the people from Morocco we listed on a plaque placed on the property? If so, then the people who are living in that structure may then gain a stronger appreciation of the efforts put into their living space. This could also help to establish/continue an acceptance of people from another country.

"Outside the Citadel," Education for Socially Engaged Art,and the Ghana Think Tank video all provided insight into / examples of how the boundaries of creating art have become blurrier and how art is increasingly "not about art." What does this mean? What was art (supposed to be) about?
Is it the strokes, lines, ratios, colors, and such? (Excuse me; I don't really know what I'm talking about! Haven't delved into art as a subject much!)
 
And does it matter: Does it matter that art is now so much more service than aesthetics? Is it for better or for worse?
I would imagine that it's better: there is more progress in society when art is a medium or tool we can use to reach out a helping hand to people in need, coming up with solutions to problems. And it makes it so art is not such "an isolated world," as mentioned in "Outside the citadel." But does it detract from the aesthetic, historical, cultural, or other value of art in forms we are more familiar with?

I enjoyed all of the readings, stories and videos. 
My most favorite story about innovation was "paraSITE". I found it extremely innovative that it started with an idea that not only helps the homeless, but how they were able to create it out of trash bags and zip blog bags. I also really like how they can fit two people within the inflatable shelter and how five dollars can build a movable and changeable home for them and all they needed was to add onto a heating vent. 
The only questions that I had was:
1) How do you compare "paraSITE" innovation of inflatable shelters to the Service Innovation Handbook Forward that we read?
2) How does Ghana Think Tank connect with  "Can't Stop Won't Stop Introduction?"
3) What does "Backpack Makers Rethink a Student Staple,"paraSITE, Service Innovation Handbook have in common?

Is it really that innovative if one is really smashing one object, like a battery charger into a backpack? Or is it a lesser sort of innovation?
What enables the reformulation of a concept, a leap that seemed previously unthinkable versus merely adding a new component to an existing product, which seems more like an upgrade?
When art exists in new mediums, such as in a humanitarian manner, within the realm of social practice, is it really art? I would think so given the creativity and skill involved. However, where then do the bounds of art and not art lie?

There is some hypocrisy here: doesn’t adding more separate accessories further encourage the bundling together of wires inside the backpack due to convenience? Aren’t they perhaps taking the wrong perspective? Don’t people stuff in their power cords for speed and simplicity? The “burrito” takes time and precision. If the developments of backpacks have gone stagnant, then why try to push it further as a “backpack”? Wouldn’t be far smarter for a company to expand their production into other products?

Why are we so divisive about our definitions of culture? Why do we find the need to categorize what is anything in the first place? What if there was a future where categorization was not necessary?

The Ghana think tank situation was hilarious. At first I thought to myself that is utterly genius! But then as they were answering I realized that those in different countries probably did not fully comprehend the circumstance or issues those Americans were going through. It is sort of like having your aunt trying to help you solve an issue with your sister rather than your mom coming up with a solution. Your aunt wouldn't be able to understand fully the circumstance of your home. What do you guys think about that method of problem solving? How do you think culture determines what we deem to be both problems and solutions? 
I think that the New York Times backpack article was a really interesting comparison to the ghana think tank because all the problems and ideas concerning backpacks are so cultural. I wonder what solution people in ghana would have for us struggling to carry our technology and pens in a eco-friendly, stylish, business encouraging manner. When that article talked about how backpacks are becoming more acceptable in the working world I recalled discussions in class about how cultural dictates society so much. What does it matter if you make an amazing product if people don't want to wear it because it doesn't look cool?
It is clear to me that ultimately the paraSITE project is ultimately an art project. I personally think that because it was created by an artist and is featured at the MOMA that it becomes more of a visual social commentary and an aesthetic sculpture than an effective policy to address homelessness. I think that is okay because it is powerful in the form that it is but I think others from a different practice rather than an artistic one might criticize it as a business failure or a social failure because only 30 were distributed. What do you guys think about this idea? Do you think that though projects can effectively combine may practices they usually can satisfy the intentions of only one practice?

1. Something that has always really confused and inspired me about innovation is how the need to innovate arises. It always feels like there's some sort of internal motivation as with the paraSITE project and social practice art, but there are also cases of corporates innovating to make more money. So is there really intrinsic difference in innovating for social value and solving a need you see in the world or just for the sake of generating revenue? 
2. For the Ghana project, it seems like interviewing clients/stakeholders is super integral for these projects to succeed. What sort of questions are you supposed to ask without being biased with a Western mindset?

1. Response to backpacks
Reading this article made me  reflect on my past experiences as a consumer. It is really easy to forget about all the marketing, research, and design that is involved in the creation of products. The most common response to a useful addition to something like a backpack would be "Oh, that's so cool", not "Oh wow, they sure did their research in finding what would be most useful". I found the potential for innovation in backpack very interesting.  
2. Regarding "Outside the Citadel"
I thought this article was interesting and thought provoking, as well as did a good job in reporting the various new forms of art popping up throughout the nation. My issue with it though is that it did not quite clarify what constitutes itself as art. I understand that the point was that the definition is expanding, but to me, it seemed that many of the projects were not necessarily using making art, but doing community service or journalism. Isn't it just an act renaming of volunteerism to art? What purpose or benefit does it service in being considered art?
I also thought the mention of art classes paid for by bartering was brilliant.

Whether it is through design, innovation, or the practice of art, it seems like a common thread for the need to create is to solve a problem at hand. I know we touched on why we feel the need to innovate in class, but what other motivations may there be in creating, designing, or participating in these practices?
I noticed that across the readings, there are differences in the way that problems are framed. For Michael Rakowitz's paraSITE project, it aimed to tackle the problem of homelessness (George L.'s shelter cost $5 and two hours perhaps?), or the Ghana Think Tank aimed to subvert the idea of a first world country solving problems for a developing country, and DJ Kool Herc has noticed that the hip-hop generation has a problem with being focused on meaningful issues and is more inclined to speak towards their "bling-bling." While all of these issues are certainly subjectively important for those who are affected or involved with these issues or in these communities, it begs the question: can we, as people who are well aware of these issues, effectively value one problem over another? Does the changing climate of backpack sales have any more meaning or value than stimulating societal dialogue through social practice art?

Questions and Thoughts about the readings:
1) It would be interesting to combine the backpack and papaSITE: the shelter is part of the backpack, therefore homeless people can become travelers/nomads, and maybe even no longer viewed as homeless.
2) Can the backpack be also transformed into a lap desk? it would help in working everywhere.
3) Why is it that development does not put an end to people's problems? Some "first-world problems" sound very superficial and naive. Yet it seems people from less developed countries have interesting solutions for such problems, without really looking down on them.

Today, in a class about personal finance, my professor discussed the statistic that people who are primed to money (basically have money on the mind) are less likely to be helpful toward others and make friends. I wonder why that is. Perhaps people have tunnel vision and exclude anything that isn't directly increasing their personal gain. After watching the think tank video, I truly began to wonder why Americans have such a weak sense of community and only come together after terribly traumatic events such as 9/11. It is true that money cannot create happiness, but why are Americans so unhappy when they have every reason to be happy? We have so many problems that can be fixed with just a little creativity, so why can't people be more encouraging and accepting of change? We want things to improve but want everything to stay the same. And lastly, why are Americans so focused on individuality rather than the community at large?

By designing new backpacks for the technological era, are these new JanSport backpacks going to be shaped to fit our needs or are we instead going to have to shape our needs/uses according to the product?

Yes, fashion has the ability to empower people, but it has also served to hinder us in the past.

Ghana ThinkTank claims that it “’develops the first world” by flipping traditional power dynamics, allowing the ‘third world’ to intervene into the lives of the people living in the so-called “developed” world.” Do you think that the message of the organization is more effective if the solutions generated by the think tanks are off-the-wall advice (pointing to the culturally biased ineffective solutions often given to ‘developing’ countries) or if these are think tanks give productive solutions?

In the backpack article, I don’t think the user studies with extreme backpack users effectively translated into actually design inspirations. I think observing and interviewing students, the backpacks target users, was in itself sufficient to gather enough design insights. How can one decide when they should end the research phase and just start getting the designs down on paper?
I loved how the paraSITE tents exposed many social issues all in one object: energy waste, homelessness, inhumane city regulations, etc. I wonder how much reach and impact this project produced. Was its audience just passersby and a few art lovers who read about the project? How to make the project known by more people?

In Can't Stop Won't Stop , DJ Kool Herc says that it is the responsibility of successful hip hop artists to address “real issues,” but he also acknowledges that many use hip hop as a way to escape, and that hip hop has the unique ability to reach an audience across race and socioeconomic boundaries. How much do you think the “shallow” lyrics of popular hip hip songs allow it to be so widespread? Do you think songs that deal with more specific and important social issues would be able to reach as many people?

“Designing is about specifics. Unlike science or even art, which deal mainly with abstraction, design brings the focus of our attention to the concrete.” (Education For Socially Engaged Art)This class is looking at the ways in which the arts and business are similar, how they intersect. In which important ways are they different. What could they learn from each other? Is the middle ground design?
