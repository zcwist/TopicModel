            <div data-bind="message" class="message user_content enhanced"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of innovation is taking what you experience, including what you read, and thinking about the missing pieces, the next steps, or just something you are curious about. In each module of PFPS,&nbsp;you will do so with one or more of the readings from that week by considering the application of the concepts in the readings to your own life and work, capturing your thoughts on the Discussions pages in bCourses and responding to your classmates’ posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s introductory readings ask you to consider “design thinking”, "positive deviance" and “lean start-up” (aka hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship) frameworks, the basic mindsets and capabilities that underlie them and how they might play out in your lives or the organizations you work in. &nbsp;As you read, think about the parallels and differences among the three approaches to innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compose a thoughtful answer to the questions: what are the similarities and differences among “design thinking”, "positive deviance" and “lean start-up”? &nbsp;For example, how are&nbsp;the personal skills or mindsets required by each similar or different? &nbsp;In what ways have the organizations you've worked in supported the development of these skills or mindsets? In what ways might they better support these approaches? Which approaches are likely to be most valuable in the Applied Innovation course you are taking? &nbsp;What questions do you have about the approaches that you would like to discuss with your classmates? &nbsp;Be specific in your responses. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Post </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">your response, including questions for your classmates, on bCourses </span><strong><i>and </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">then </span><strong><i>respond </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>to at least two</strong></em> of your classmates.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>General Guidelines for Discussion:</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Be thoughtful, constructive and inclusive. &nbsp;In your responses, be kind, present objections or different points of view open to the possibility that there may be a reasonable response, and object to the responses rather than to the people. &nbsp;Objections are fine, but you can also choose to be constructive, and you needn't repeat&nbsp;the same objection multiple times. &nbsp;Be inclusive in your contributions, acknowledging previous contributions, avoiding unnecessarily offensive examples. &nbsp;It is perfectly alright to raise questions that may seem to you to be unsophisticated or uninformed. &nbsp;This is a place to learn and explore. &nbsp;There are no right or wrong answers.</span></p></div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">At first glance, real estate comes across as the least likely industry to welcome the lean startup model. The minimum viable product in real estate is most often the final completed product, which can take three or more years to entitle, finance, and construct. Once the foundation is in place, it is nearly impossible to “pivot” the building’s design or even halt construction. At the peak of a real estate cycle, developers march ahead with “built-it-and-they-will-come” optimism; the results are often empty buildings and abandoned subdivisions.
At the same time, many themes from lean startups, design thinking, and positive deviance can positively direct our real estate project – and future assignments in the industry. In particular, the initial stages of market research and investment proposal demand creative thinking, hypothesis designing (if not testing), and consumer observing. From the highest and best use analysis, real estate developers must consider the emotional proposition of the project. What do tenants want? Why do they want to move here? What will make them satisfied?
A common thread between lean startups and design thinking is the push for prototypes. Although the MVP approach might not work in real estate, investors can make an early effort to model outcomes based on existing market demand. For instance, they can review similar properties nearby and evaluate the sources of success – a connection to the positive deviance strategy as well. Of course, determining whether those results are externally valid to our project is another challenge, but we can address it with another lesson from design thinking: observe what consumers like about other projects. Here we can take the role of anthropologists and discern what consumers and experts actually prefer.
Overall, our project must seek to capture real estate’s most elusive objective: flexibility. Real estate developers often refer to optionality, which is the ability to change project plans at each stage of the cycle. For instance, we may propose an alternative to our initial plan if we encounter entitlement obstacles. Alternatively, we could plan the project in phases so we can test market demand before exhausting our capital commitment. Bringing in technology, we should employ as much data as we can to capture current market dynamics.
With these thoughts in mind, I have a few follow-up questions:

What sorts of tests can we run to determine market demand?
What are the risks of relying on market comparables?
How can we use technology to outsmart competitors’ market analysis?
What hypotheses can we generate? How can we measure initial success?

Although the MVP approach might not work in real estate, investors can make an early effort to model outcomes based on existing market demand. For instance, they can review similar properties nearby and evaluate the sources of success – a connection to the positive deviance strategy as well. Of course, determining whether those results are externally valid to our project is another challenge, but we can address it with another lesson from design thinking: observe what consumers like about other projects. Here we can take the role of anthropologists and discern what consumers and experts actually prefer.</p>
<p>Overall, our project must seek to capture real estate’s most elusive objective: flexibility. Real estate developers often refer to optionality, which is the ability to change project plans at each stage of the cycle. For instance, we may propose an alternative to our initial plan if we encounter entitlement obstacles. Alternatively, we could plan the project in phases so we can test market demand before exhausting our capital commitment. Bringing in technology, we should employ as much data as we can to capture current market dynamics.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in mind, I have a few follow-up questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What sorts of tests can we run to determine market demand?</li>
<li>What are the risks of relying on market comparables?</li>
<li>How can we use technology to outsmart competitors’ market analysis?</li>
<li>What hypotheses can we generate? How can we measure initial success?</li>
</ul></div>

I'm a huge fan when it comes to real estate on what you mention above about asking all the big questions early. Going to the location, knocking on doors, talking to neighbors, store owners, landlords, postal workers, etc. Knowing the culture of an area or possible a change in culture, can be critical. Like you mention though, it can also be very hard to determine and quantify.
I also think the phase approach to a development and construction plan seems to be a great way to pivot like you discuss. Have some flexibility to perhaps adjust a design mid build or re-purpose a function seems to be an excellent approach if it can be done without a large resource lift.
What are you thought on technologies use when it comes market analysis? Do you think no traditional real estate apps and technology could surprise us in their use for research and analytics? i.e. Could a dating app help with social and economical research in a region?</div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">When I look at design thinking I think of innovation and a culture of flexibility and creative change. On a similar but slightly different note, lean start up beings out the engineer in me with a hypothesis focus and more structured thought regime. And in a very different approach, positive deviance seems to try to establish a new norm contrary to what may already be a norm or habit.
Working in the military, all three approaches were prevalent but produces many challenges. For example, innovation was critical and often a design thinking approach was needed, but due to the rigidity of the military structure, it could often be hard to get the buy in needed to affect change. Trying to let senior officers know that you had some ideas you wanted to implement that may or may not work, but could likely lead to a solution, was often uncomfortable in the government/military environment. That being said, one of the largest and most recent projects I worked on was the implementation of a forward operating helicopter base that ran 24/7 in a remote region. I used to have meetings and it was common to have to admit that we didn't know what the solutions were, in fact we didn't even know the problems we would face. We needed to back track even further to find out what the needs were to then discover what problems could arise to then work on problem solution.
On the other hand, a hypothesis driven approach was a little more acceptable in the military aviation experience I had. Approaching a problem that could be structured to reduce waste was viewed favorably and could be implemented among large groups of people of ranging job requirements, needs and desires.
In military aviation, safety was an important topic and we study safety and safety culture at length and developed lots of improvements and programs to enhance our safety. After all, when there are safety issues involving people, airplanes and helicopters, the risks are high. One Operation risk management topic was the deviation of normalization. This reminds me a little of the positive deviation we read about. In &nbsp;my experience, it could be possible that the maintenance procedure card that a mechanic followed could have steps that could be improved upon. It could also be possible that the mechanic would not follow the procedure card and would do their own steps to make the job quicker or better. The inherent problem with this is that the cards are meant to be the standardization tool for safety and deviating is not ok. But what if it actually is better to deviate? We would train our never to deviate but rather, look for those opportunities for change, discuss them and work to make the change so the whole fleet can benefit while still keeping the integrity of the sacred maintenance procedure card system in tact.
One of the main reasons I chose business school was to take a military background and merge it with a civilian future. I'm excited to see and learn new ways to take old experiences and improve on them as well as discover better approaches to PFPS.

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">i really appreciated your varied perspectives on these approaches - as you point out, the lean startup model is not a panacea for the problems we face. But, as you mention as well, our first challenging is correctly defining the problems we have now. For instance, we're all aware of the housing affordability crisis in the Bay. But how do we define it? A problem of supply vs. demand, free market vs. regulated market? If we don't clarify the source issue, we risk developing imperfect solutions - case in point: rent control.</div>

But, as you mention as well, our first challenging is correctly defining the problems we have now. For instance, we're all aware of the housing affordability crisis in the Bay. But how do we define it? A problem of supply vs. demand, free market vs. regulated market? If we don't clarify the source issue, we risk developing imperfect solutions - case in point: rent control.</p></div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">All three approaches are geared toward challenging the status quo and fostering innovation but they vary in their process and approach. The design thinking and lean startup mindsets seem to apply more to those attempting to creating something out of nothing. These processes facilitate the innovation process in ways that minimize risk and encourage innovation through the use of prototypes, product / market fit testing and small batches / short cycle times. Furthermore, they frame risk taking in a positive light to motivate people to take moon shots and not focus on the consequences of failure. In contrast, the positive deviance approach looks for existing behaviors that produce positive change and attempts to implement these best practices from elsewhere, which may be a better tool for those who are naturally more risk averse.
&nbsp;
I began my career in investment banking and then went to make investments for Northwestern University’s endowment. The investment banking mindset is extremely structured and there is a specific way things are done. Innovation is not encouraged and the deal teams are set up to maximize efficiency and speed. The endowment investing experience was different in that while, there is a rigid investment process in place for sourcing, financial analysis and due diligence, there was an interest in improving operations and being flexible / entrepreneurial. My colleagues focused on achieving this improvement through the positive deviance approach by comparing processes with successful peer organizations.
&nbsp;
In both of these roles, mistakes were not tolerable, so launching early and often was not appropriate and innovation came with significant financial risks associated with failure. Tracking the appropriate data was an obstacle for running effective A/B tests because the endowment did not have the correct systems in place. Upgrading back-office functionality to make this type of testing possible would be a good place to start.
&nbsp;
In the real estate applied innovation course, positive deviance will be important to understand why competitors are successful and why certain transactions have done well, in order to replicate success. In real estate development, the application of the lean startup framework could also be helpful to fully vet various stages of the project before making significant capital investments. I would be curious to know if others have made unsuccessful investments that could have been avoided or improved by utilizing these frameworks.</div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">You bring up of the most pressing issues with applying lean startup to real estate: the MVP is a fully entitled and completed building. In the four years it takes to build one of those, we cannot afford costly errors. For that reason, successful real estate investors minimize risk, often obsessively. Connecting to other ideas from you and David, I think the revolution in real estate has to come from the process. Can we streamline market research with big data? Can we test positive deviance more rapidly once cities digitize transactions? Can we try out products in stages? These questions are all worth pondering in both this course and our Golden Shovel competition.</div>

  <div data-bind="message" class="message user_content enhanced"><p>You bring up of the most pressing issues with applying lean startup to real estate: the MVP is a fully entitled and completed building. In the four years it takes to build one of those, we cannot afford costly errors. For that reason, successful real estate investors minimize risk, often obsessively. Connecting to other ideas from you and David, I think the revolution in real estate has to come from the process. Can we streamline market research with big data? Can we test positive deviance more rapidly once cities digitize transactions? Can we try out products in stages? These questions are all worth pondering in both this course and our Golden Shovel competition.</p></div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">Design thinking, positive deviance, and lean start-up all work towards solving a problem, but they also hesitate to declare the problem from the outset. They are characterized by an openness to learn something new about the problem, and possibly re-frame the question fundamentally. Design thinking focuses on re-framing the problem to determine what the real motivate Positive Deviance is not about finding a new solution, but identifying an interesting, already existing solution &amp; seeing how to scale it or apply it to something larger. Lean Start up is a more business-minded approach that focuses on identifying the minimum viable products needed to disprove a hypothesis, and then, based on results, choosing to perservere or pivoting to achieve product market fit.
&nbsp;
Interpersonal Skills are essential for all of these, but it seems that design thinking and positive deviance both require one to reserve their judgement and their opinions in order to be effective. One has to assume one doesn’t know the answer, whereas the iterative approach of lean start-up is less about humility in the face of the unknown, and more about trying many things rapidly to exhaust ideas that don’t work to learn and adapt. Design thinking and positive deviance do differ in the way they ask people to innovate – positive deviance suggests that the solution is out there, and needs assistance to scale, while design thinking is open to the possibility that the solution may be pieced together from existing realities, or may http://ny.curbed.com/2017/1/30/14438550/421-a-independent-budget-office-study-nycbe something entirely new. Lean Start-up will likely be the most pertinent to the Real Estate Applied Innovation Class I am taking.
&nbsp;
I worked at a company that was founded on a human-centered approach to product design. In the office, I once referred to what we did as designing for the full spectrum of users, but the president, Alex Lee, interjected and said that wasn’t true. There are users on either end – the highly skilled and the profoundly disabled – who you cannot design for without making you product inaccessible to the majority. Instead, by focusing on the middle 90-95% percent, we tried to be as inclusive as possible while recognizing our solutions were not universal. The most visible way this was imparted to us on a daily basis was the OXO glove wall. On the East side of our test kitchen / lunch dining hall, there were dozens of gloves found, collected, tagged, and laundered) from the streets of New York. Alex asked employees to pick up gloves when they found them in the early 90’s when the company was still quite small.&nbsp; The wall was a highly visible reminder of the different hand sizes of people, but also the many reasons why one might wear a glove.
&nbsp;
I would like to know my classmates honest opinions about design thinking, including any skepticism and critiques. I think that among evangelists, the word has so much power that it is applied ubiquitously and loses meaning. I am very curious to know what skeptics think, and frankly to perhaps find a different term that more specifically says&nbsp;what is meant as this one is diluted through over-use.</div>

I think it is this uniquely “human” element that lies at the center of a lot of what has been discussed.&nbsp; Similar to others, I think this phased approach, deviating from the “all-or-nothing” view that we often see in practice, is certainly something to consider.&nbsp; However, I think the unavoidable wrinkle lies in the fact that real estate projects ultimately result from the convergence of a multitude of interests had by a variety of stakeholders.&nbsp; These stakeholders not only have different primary interests, but also diverging views on the world and the way it should operate.&nbsp; This inevitably begets an incredibly complicated, slow-moving process through which one must push forward various types of real estate projects.&nbsp; For example, a developer and potentially community members may prefer a phased approach, but capital providers, e.g. big banks, would certainly not be ok with delaying project completion and increasing perceived risk if they have any say over it.
Real estate is such an all-encompassing topic, it sometimes seems daunting to try and be innovative in this space.&nbsp; However, I agree with John think it may be useful to try to apply the techniques we’ve discussed not just to the projects themselves, but to the systems that oftentimes stand in the way of completion of projects.&nbsp; For example, we could potentially use design thinking to implement innovative political processes or create local governing bodies that actually work to manage structural changes to the built environment as opposed to simply being conduits for individual political agendas.&nbsp; It’s worth mentioning that, at the heart of these issues, is self-interest.&nbsp; Why build a better building if you can build a lesser one and make more money.&nbsp; I don’t think we will ever be able to solve the self-interest problem, but we might be able to put measures in place to separate or eliminate some of the roadblocks that currently exist.</div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">I've been hearing about "design thinking" since I started looking into business school a few years ago. It's not a phrase I ever heard in design school, though that probably makes sense since it's implied. The process of "imagine, prototype, test, analyze, refine," seems so natural that I'm curious what the work process is like in non-design focused organizations.
I've written similar responses a few times now, but since this whole thread is about the intersection of design and real estate, it's probably worth repeating. In my experience, I can identify to problems with the way architecture/construction/real estate currently operate that results in so little innovation.
1) There's no incentive to innovate, because&nbsp;development only happens in supply-constrained markets with captive user bases. For San Francisco companies, if you need office space, you're lucky to find any at all, so as a supplier, why try to improve it?
2) We study, research, design, prototype, and build, but I'm not aware of many architects or real estate developers who go back and undertake rigorous analysis of previous projects looking for successes and failures. The final step, rather than "analyze" is just "move on." I think the same is true at the city scale for urban planners.</div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">What are the similarities and differences among “design thinking”, "positive deviance" and “lean start-up”?&nbsp;

All three concepts rely on a certain level of "open-mindedness" - a willingness to depart from the conventional. It will be interesting to see the evolution of professionals as these more innovative ways of doing business become generally accepted.&nbsp;
All three concepts seem to advocate for the same general process of trial and error - bringing experimentation to management and business, but they differ in their level of process definition. The lean start-up provides a defined approach to innovation as a process for enterprise creation. Design thinking is a prescription for a new mindset or framework for thinking. Positive deviance strikes me an effort to discover and implement best practices (a less innovative concept).&nbsp;

How are&nbsp;the personal skills or mindsets required by each similar or different? &nbsp;

All of the concepts require an ability to accept new things and a willingness to be uncomfortable. I think the positive deviance concept requires less departure from traditional business frameworks as it strikes me as similar to standard business improvement concepts.&nbsp;

In what ways have the organizations you've worked in supported the development of these skills or mindsets?

Bank of America definitely did not have a design-centric culture, and I have trouble finding many similarities between our practices and the lean start-up concept. I think that was more a result of being heavily regulated than a result of the organization's culture. It's hard to change and innovate when every change brings with it regulatory scrutiny. However, in instances when it was possible to experiment, iterate and pivot we did.&nbsp;
When it comes to positive deviance, we were constantly assessing what our peers were doing well (both internally and externally) and trying to determine what practice led to those results. We would then implement those changes.

Which approaches are likely to be most valuable in the Applied Innovation course you are taking? &nbsp;

I'm interested to see how my team will implement these concepts and approaches. Real estate development is a slow process and is highly regulated - I think it lends itself nicely to reactive/flexible strategies has your preconceived strategies and ideas are constantly tested and your ability to react often determines your success.&nbsp;

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">Module 1 Discussion: Innovation Processes - Real Estate Investment and Market Analysis
Each of the three approaches described have many similarities and differences. &nbsp;I think their primary differences stem from the circumstances within which one would find themselves using one of these approaches. &nbsp;For example, using the lean start-up approach may be best when designing a business model, but design thinking may be best suited for designing a product or service. &nbsp;Ultimately, I believe that one may use a combination of all three strategies when launching a business or solving a problem. &nbsp;With that said, certain differences stand out to me. &nbsp;Whereas design thinking primarily focuses on the end user's experience, particularly their emotional response to using a product or service, positive deviance seems to focus more on the overall utility and societal benefit that is derived from an individual's behavior. &nbsp;In addition, the two approaches differ in terms of their processes as well. &nbsp;One relies on rapid experimentation and prototyping to create solutions while the other leverages existing use cases that can be scaled to provide greater value. &nbsp;The lean start-up approach is similar to design thinking in that both are proponents of using relatively cheap methods to test prototypes and develop multiple iterations in a brief period of time.
With that said, the applicability and value of each of these approaches seems to be very context specific. &nbsp;For example, in my own professional experience working in Compliance at Goldman Sachs, these strategies didn't have much prevalence. &nbsp;Granted, I was not working in formalized strategy or production role, but my division did have internally provided services and clients who used them. &nbsp;However, strategic decisions were made with the primary goal of loss-prevention, i.e., our goal was always to avoid regulatory or legal penalties while also facilitating commercial results. &nbsp;Ultimately, this mindset fostered more of a reactive approach to dealing with problems and little time was allowed for strategy to optimize processes or even creating new ones that may challenge the status quo. &nbsp;Change and improvements occurred very slowly and often seemed to not be sufficient for the challenges we faced.
I believe a combination of these approaches will work best for real estate depending on what stage of the process we find ourselves in. &nbsp;Determining the highest and best use proposal for our site will require us to use design thinking techniques understand what will deliver the most value to end users. &nbsp;The positive deviance approach will also be valuable as it is often useful to leverage comparable properties or transactions when structuring financing packages.
I am most interested in learning the frameworks needed to implement each of these strategies in an efficient way such that we can leverage them with our Applied Innovation projects.</div>

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">There are a few similarities among the three articles that I read. All of them recommend us to validate our hypotheses through testing or modeling. In the "Lean Startup," the testing phase happens in 'Step 5.

In our project, we find that the positive deviance method is the best approach because real estate is an old business with many examples of successes already practiced by others. &nbsp;A housing project is subject to constrains by the zoning regulations, density, height, etc. &nbsp;Thus the scope of what's allowable is limited. This is similar to the many constraints medical professionals find the developing countries. &nbsp;We need to find an example somewhere that has worked and tailor our project accordingly to the specificities of our project. &nbsp;Our scope is small for the industry standard and thus we are not aiming to turn the industry up side down.
One question that I have for my classmates is:
How many times have you pivoted your designs after interacting with your clients and found out what they really want? &nbsp;And when did you actually tell them what they really want is another solution that you proposed?

      <div class="show-if-collapsed discussion-subtitle summary ellipsis">In many ways, all three of these methods are similar. They all involve a new way of doing something, an experiment to test the efficacy of that innovation, and then either expanding or discarding the innovation based on test results. Design thinking and the lean startup are very similar, in that they involve a process of “hypothesize, prototype, test, analyze,” to facilitate progress. The design thinking process applies more to a single product or process within a business. The lean startup method applies to the creation of a whole new business model. Both rely on rapid iteration. Lean startup methods also focus specifically on keeping costs low. In design thinking, prototypes are equivalent to the lean startup’s “minimum viable product.”
&nbsp;
Positive deviance is almost like a balance between design thinking and natural evolution. Rather than create innovative prototype processes or products, one goes into a poorly functioning environment and tries to find experimental alternatives that have developed organically (e.g., a mother giving a child a unique and unusually nutritious diet.) The innovation and experiment have already happened, it just needs to be identified and implemented on a larger scale.
&nbsp;
Architecture tries to implement design thinking. We conducted thorough interviews of our end users and designed spaces based on their needs. Where the system broke was in a failure to analyze the results once users were actually interacting with the prototype/finished product. Thus all the firm had at the end of the project was knowledge of what ideas were successful aesthetically, (as evaluated from photographs, mostly) but not what was (un)successful functionally. The major step my old architecture firm needs to take to close the innovation loop is to conduct rigorous post-occupancy evaluations of buildings and use this information as the basis of future projects. There was some element of “positive deviance,” in that we spent a lot of time studying other architects’ buildings looking for things they had done exceptionally well, to incorporate into our own designs. Though not a big issue in the architecture world, in other spheres this process seems likely to lead to a patent or copyright lawsuit.
&nbsp;
From my classmates, I’m curious if you ever had experience using a “lean startup” process to develop a new business line within an existing corporation, and does it work the same? Also, has anyone had an experience using the “positive deviance” method, outside of the third-world examples in the article? Is this applicable to the businesses most of us will be dealing with?</div>
