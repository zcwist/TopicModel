The main similarities between the three concepts are, for me, the fact that they're hypothesis-driven and that they rely a lot on observation and experimentation. Of the three, the one that is the most different is positive deviance. While design thinking and lean start-up converge to suggest and test a hypothesis, positive deviance draws the hypothesis from observation.
In my experience with previous organizations, there wasn't experimentation, room for failure, or focus on the client. There was little variation from project to project and we relied a lot on experts to tell us the best way to do things. The one thing that did help innovation, however, was assuming that most of the times the client didn't know what he / she wanted and we had to find that out (sort of like the example of someone asking for a bridge). 
In this Applied Innovation course, specifically, I believe that asking Why? instead of How? will very useful at the beginning. After that, the testing our hypothesis will make a difference in the results of our projects; most of the clients are asking for something they've never made before. Testing our hypothesis and models will make our final recommendations more implementable and will amplify their impact.
The questions I have for the rest of the group are:
1) How do you think you could test the hypothesis of the project?
2) How will you prioritize the hypothesis you will test?
