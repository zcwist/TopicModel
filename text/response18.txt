Design thinking, positive deviance and lean start-up all have the commonality of being focused on efficiently finding solutions. They differ in terms of how to get there. Design thinking provides a framework for generating hypothesis. Lean startup methodologies advocate for ways to test these hypotheses in an efficient manner while positive deviance allows for replicating these hypotheses on a great scale.
In Social sector solutions we have definitely relied heavily on design thinking, generating various hypotheses with regards to the issues our client was facing before putting them through a ‘lean start-up’ process of testing those ideas and finding which ones appeared to be most promising selecting which ones we would pursue in depth. Once we identified the key ideas we relied on positive deviance to replicate our finding across the various department of the GoldenGate National Park.
I am curious to hear how my classmates have been able to use these approaches in a corporate setting. More specifically, what challenges have you faced in your organizations when trying to take a design thinking and lead startup approach to defining and testing hypotheses?
