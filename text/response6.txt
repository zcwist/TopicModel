One of the key similarities in the three concepts discussed is scale - start small! Positive deviance looks for localized success; it doesn't try to build up a database of every success in the country or region. Design thinking is all about taking customer feedback and prototyping quickly and at a small scale, as that makes failure more tolerable and easier to recover from. Lean start ups also espouse this small-scale philosophy, as evidenced by the Minimum Viable Product. If we are to expect and welcome failure, small scale is required. So, in the services space, there must be a way to come up with a prototype or MVP for a service (minimum viable service). I think of the education space and am reminded of an education entrepreneurship incubator from New Orleans called 4.0 Schools. Their philosophy in "Solving" education is to have a high volume of innovative thinkers coming up with localized solutions to localized challenges - finding the local successes (positive deviance), working closely and deeply with families and students (a key principle of design thinking), and developing a minimum viable prototype (a key element of lean startups). This is an emotionally heavy space, as we're talking about children and their futures, but 4.0 has proven that you can apply these traditionally product-oriented philosophies to even the most nuanced of services.
I'm curious how to apply these concepts as consultants - it seems that you need deep commitment from leadership (if you're not the leader) to be able to take these kinds of risks. What do you think? For example, if we're trying to implement a certification program at REDF, how are we supposed to use design thinking? Perhaps propose a prototyping path that allows REDF to phase in their certifications? That could work, but I get the sense that for this kind of project, if you don't have scale in who is certified, the certifications wouldn't really mean much.Â
