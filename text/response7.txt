Design thinking, positive deviance, and lean startup methodology all seek to solve a customer's or community's problems efficiently, but they combine end user research, iteration, and solution generation in different ways.  Where positive deviance posits the solution to a problem already lies within the community and only needs to identified and rolled out, design thinking and LSM seek to deeply understand customers and create new solutions while in dialogue with customers.  Design thinking starts the conversation with customers early, whereas LSM tends to focus more on the entrepreneur's initial insights and then incorporates customer feedback to an MVP. All three note the importance of revealed preferences - design thinking and LSM focus on not just what people say but what they do, and positive deviance values the culturally and economically feasible.In my prior role, I worked to help primary care practices improve their processes and better serve patients.  We often came in with a defined set of goals for the clinic to achieve and new processes to implement.  We tried to modify the tactics for each clinic's culture and staffing model, though we could have been better.  We often looked for positive deviance among clinics to identify how others had achieved impressive results with limited resources.  Where we and much of medical care failed was engaging with patients themselves to understand what they wanted from their care.  We would have strongly benefited from a design thinking and more iterative approach.
