A common trait of design thinking, positive deviance, and lean start-up is being solution-focused from the start of any endeavor. While design thinking is the approach often associated with the notion of taking a human-centered approach, positive deviance and lean start-up also seem to have the human, or the end-user, in mind and some points in the process. Where they differ is in the finer points of approach and execution. Design thinking requires a human-centered approach at all times, positive deviance is focused on using uncommon strategies to find better solutions, and lean start-up requires hypothesis-driven experimentation and continual iteration. For our Social Sector Solutions project, I imagine that design thinking will be the most relevant. The scope of our work will not require radical solutions that have never been done before. Rather, we will be doing a lot of research and making recommendations for how our client and other like organizations could better collaborate or expand into certain geographic and demographic markets.
