I worked at an organization that conceived of itself as a "startup nonprofit". It was young, and there was a lot of change, and there was discussion about embracing failure to learn, but that's where the similarities ended with the lean startup model. In fact anything that seemed like failure led to criticism and blame, and we were not able to iterate on the leaderships' ideas or try to reframe the problems - we just had to execute on the projects we were given. I think that's one of the dangers of the popularization of these types of models is that they get distilled down into buzz words and applied without a true understanding of the underlying principles and logic.
 
Positive deviance troubles me. It's one thing to start with a hypothesis of what will help people in a given situation, and then have an intervention and see if it works. But as described in the article, positive deviance is identifying people who are doing relatively better than others and then looking for similarities between them to reverse-engineer the cause. That seems like it could lead to useful insights, but could just as easily lead to confirmation bias and oversimplify causal relationships.
I think that the design thinking model's critical eye to what the real problem really is (as opposed to the problem the client presents) will probably be the most applicable to our course projects.
