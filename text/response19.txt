Design thinking, positive deviance and lean startup are similar in that both are ways to approach a problem an individual is facing but they differentiate among themselves because each of them uses a different methodology. Design thinking is an essential tool for simplifying and humanizing, and it help you develop empathy with users, tolerance for failure and a discipline to develop a prototype but gives you challenges regarding accepting ambiguity, embracing risk and resetting expectations. Positive deviance is the observation that in some settings, at risk individuals experience better outcomes than their neighbors when experiencing similar risks. It allows you to compare different results from people in different situations. Finally, lean start-up involves the whole process from developing a vision, transforming it to a hypothesis, develop products, pivot and adjust.
Organizations are using each time more design thinking approaches and are giving individual contributors more opportunities and spaces (physical or virtual) to build upon their ideas. For example, working at Dell, my team organized one week in which we left our daily responsibilities to think in how to resolve different issues in our team. We had one week to make design thinking exercises and try to come up with a different approach for the problem we experienced. It was really useful because when you are focused on your daily responsibilities, you donâ€™t find time for this kind of exercises.
