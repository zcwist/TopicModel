In reading about design thinking, lean start-ups, and positive deviance approaches, I found them to have a great deal of similarities, especially in terms of the end goal - they all prioritize active learning/exploration, which builds to innovation, as a means to a better product, service, or solution. However, design thinking definitely seems to be the most human-centered approach, followed closely by positive deviance and, furthest, the lean start-up methodology. Along the same vein, if I had to choose which two approaches are the most similar, I would say design thinking and positive deviance, for the reason listed above and because positive deviance reminded me of the design thinking concept of "building for extremes." When it comes to my S3 project, I'm intrigued by and see value in each of these approaches, but believe that design thinking will be the most relevant, because resolving the answer to our problem statement (should our client invest in creating a leadership development program and, if so, how?) is contingent upon understanding whether desirability for this program exists. To develop this knowledge base, we'll need to engage in deep conversations with prospective "end users" and design to meet their needs/wants and reduce existing pain points. One question these readings raised for me is whether there is a role for analytics in design thinking. Having worked in analytics consulting for the past four years, I see an opportunity to blend analytics with anecdotes - to go beyond figuring out what people want by developing a deep understanding of why they want it - but from the article, it seems like in the design thinking world, qualitative methods are strongly preferred to quantitative ones. Do people see value in combining analytical/anecdotal approaches - if so, how, and if not, why not?
