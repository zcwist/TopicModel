Design thinking requires empathy with users, discipline for prototyping, tolerance for failure, exhibit thoughtful restraint.
Lean startups go through steps including develop a vision, translate vision into the hypothesis, specify MVP (Minimum Viable Products) tests, prioritize tests, learn From MVP tests, persevere, pivot or perish, scaling and ongoing optimization. 
To better support these approaches: 
1) allow people to fail
2) emphasize on learnings and exploration
3) encourage discussion
