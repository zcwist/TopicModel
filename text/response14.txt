Design thinking, positive deviance and lean start-up each require teams to focus on the user experience and rely on a process to foster creative solutions to challenges the user faces. Lean start-up methodology is likely to put even more emphasis on the prototyping phase of their design process, to gather feedback as quickly as possible before investing too many resources into the project. I see positive deviance as a tool that can be used in both design thinking and lean start-up to better understand where solutions could come from -- to inform the divergent phase of ideation within the broader design thinking process.
When I have been in organizations that practice design thinking well, there has always been strong leadership -- and a strong culture of problem-solving and innovation -- to support the design process. The comfort with failing, and failing quickly, is particularly important for leaders of organizations to model, as this is the strongest message they can give to their staff to take risks in pursuit of learning and innovation. 
I am excited to employ the tools and mindsets of design thinking to our S3 project this semester.
