These three concepts are all approaches to improve survival (of ideas, health, outputs). They differ, however, in terms of the resources available to the agents employing the concepts (largely, time as the resource). Hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship and its MVP-approach to building viable solutions drives towards incremental improvements using the fewest resources possible. It is a forward-looking approach that tries to anticipate market needs to save time by developing MVP solutions. Positive deviance, however, retroactively analyzes something and then reimagines how this can be improved going forward by homing in on the most successful subjects.
 
I previously worked in management consulting, and found traces of each of these concepts in my various projects although they were often disguised. For example, I learned to employ an MVP-approach when doing "Phase 1" or ambiguous analysis in a short period of time. I often had to translate broad concepts such as "How Big is Market X?" into tactical next steps. My teammates conditioned me to ask, "what is the minimum amount of data that I need to prove this theory true or false?" This mindset was crucial on fast-paced projects because it limited me (the analyst) from the distraction of building a robust, seemingly-perfect analysis when the same outcome could have been achieved quicker. I still find this "MVP" / ruthless efficiency important to meeting deadlines today. 
 
With S3 in mind (mainly the Proposal / Scoping Letter), I am revisiting how I can employ a leaner approach to project work. For example, can our team build (aka produce a smaller, pilot deliverables), measure (aka preview them with clients), and learn (aka incorporate feedback to bolster future analysis)?
Intrigued to how others channeled these readings in the context of S3.
